# Gridap.jl

[Gridap.jl](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) is a new generation, open-source, finite element (FE) library implemented in the Julia programming language. Gridap.jl aims at adopting a more modern programming style than existing FE applications written in C/C++ or Fortran.  The library is currently able to solve linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) for scalar and vector fields, single and multi-field problems, conforming and nonconforming FE discretizations, on structured and unstructured meshes of simplices and n-cubes. Gridap is extensible and modular. One can implement new FE spaces, new reference elements, use external mesh generators, linear solvers, post-processing tools, etc. See, e.g., the list of available Gridap plugins.
